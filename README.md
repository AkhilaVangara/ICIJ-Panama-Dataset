# ICIJ-Panama-Dataset

## Usage
This is a notebook in the form of a report on the Panama Dataset. A graph was created using the subset of entities for France. This can be replicated for other countries - the entire dataset too can be used for the analysis, however, ledain community detection uses igraph which is currently unable to work on very large graphs. Thus for community detection, it is recommended to look into the initial EDA and decide on which country (or subset) of entities to explore.
This notebook can be run directly with the CSV files of the ICIJ Panama dataset either on google colab or as a jupyter notebook.
